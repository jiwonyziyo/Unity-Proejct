# Unity-Proejct
Today, I created a simple game using Unity for my project.

## 1. Game Title
**Move and Jump to Collect Apples**

## 2. Objective
- The goal of the game is to **jump over platforms**, **move to collect apples**, and **reach the finish point**.

## 3. Components
- **Player**: The character controlled by the player.
- **Apple**: Collectible apples the player needs to gather.
- **Floor**: Terrain that the player must jump over and roll on to move.
- **Finish Point**: The point the player needs to reach.

## 4. Gameplay
- The game consists of **3 stages**, each with a different number of apples to collect and unique terrain.
- If the player **collects all the apples**, they move on to the next stage. If they fail to collect all the apples, the stage restarts.
- In the final stage, after collecting all the apples and reaching the target point, a **"Game Clear"** message will be displayed.

## 5. Controls
- Arrow keys: Move the player
- Spacebar: Jump
